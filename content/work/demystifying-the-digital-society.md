Earlier this year (2018) I was fortunate enough to be asked to do the keynote at the http://digitaltransformations.org/ conference.  This conference is a unique conference as it focuses on bringins IT and the Arts together and exposes some interesting cultural questions. It was a facinating experience and one that I will cherish.  Unfortunately my keynote was not recorded but here is the slide deck and story that I told.


### Introduction
![Title Slide](/2018/10/Slide1.png#center "")

My name is Glyn Darkin, I am and IT consultant and spend my life helping my clients on their journey to being more digital. Today I will try and lift the lid on the Digital Society.

<hr/>

### Definition of Society
![Definition of Society](/2018/10/Slide2.png#center "")

To understand what the "Digital Society" means we need to unpick the term a little. According to Wikipedia *society* means

> the aggregate of people living together in more or less ordered community.

This is pretty self explanatory. For me it means that society is:

- the fabric that binds us
- our morals, principles and beliefs
- our politics, laws and judiciary systems
- our democracy, media and institutions

<hr/>

### Definition of Digital

![Definition of Digital](/2018/10/Slide3.png#center "")

Digital on the other hand is a little more nebulous. Home PCs have been around for well over 20years so whats changing now?

I believe we are at a nexus point, a driven by a number of factors that are all starting to to play to gether and changing our behaviour, economics and global economy. 

Computer technology is just the building blocks that underpin this change.

<hr/>

### The Internet

![The Internet](/2018/10/Slide4.png#center "")

Obvioulsy we have the internet. Its been around for a while now but what you may not be noticing is how just about everthing is connecting to it.  From our TVs, Phones to our watches and cards. You can find just about anything these days that is either connected to the internet or comes with an app!!

Apple's latest watch has a sim card and connects direct to the internet and our cars come with their own sim cards.

<hr/>

### Internet Users

![The Internet Users](/2018/10/Slide5.png#center "")

The internet has over 4 billions users. Those who are joining the the internet now who are not encumbered with legacy tewchnology and networks as jumping ahead. Nearly 50% of internet usage is in Asia alone. 

<hr/>

### The Cloud

![The Cloud](/2018/10/Slide6.png#center "")

To serve content to all those users we need servers, lots of servers. We call this the cloud but is actually massive warehouses the size of football pitches stocked with racks and racks of servers.  There are no more PCs under your desk. Even Microsoft want your games console to site in their datacentre. This capability gives anybody with a credit card access to immense computer power from their home. A teenager can spin up 100s of PCs in seconds!!!

Interestingly Ireland is the data center capital of Europe with Amazon, Google and Microsoft operating massive datacenters here.

<hr/>

### The Rise of Mobile

![The Rise of Mobile](/2018/10/Slide7.png#center "")

We all know the mobile story. Apple was the first trillion-dollar company this year and they dont seem to be stopping.

<hr/>

### Internet Usage Worldwide

![Internet Usage Worldwide](/2018/10/Slide8.png#center "")

We are now truly a mobile first world. Globally around 5bn people have a mobile phone. 2.5bn have a smartphone of some kind (not necessarily with a large data allowance or easy access to charging) and around 1bn, perhaps more have a high-end smartphone.
At the time of writting there are some 650-700m iPhones in use.

<hr/>

### New Supply Chains

![New Electric Supply Chains](/2018/10/Slide9.png#center "")

Becasue of the explosion in smart phones the cost and size of electronics has been driven down creating whole new supply chains for electronics equipment. This ubiquitos and cheap technology means I can get a working computer (Rasberry Pi) for under €50

<hr/>

### IOT - The Internet of Things

![Internet of Things](/2018/10/Slide10.png#center "")

We see this being played out the most in the new  wearables market where its possible to have a device on your wrist that tracks your entire life.

<hr/>

### 3d Printing

![3D Printing](/2018/10/Slide12.png#center "")

The access to cheap electronics is enabling people (makers) to build new hardware. 20 years ago I was printing 3d parts for the automotive industry. Back then the printers cost > £100,000 and the actual printed parts cost well in excess of £10,000. But now I can build a 3d printer at home for a few £100 and print out my own parts.

<hr/>

### Bitcoin

![Bitcoin](/2018/10/Slide13.png#center "")

With all this cheap hardware and software we are able to create entirely new ecosystems like Blockchain and Bitcoin.  In 2009 a man by the name of James Howell mined 7500 bitcoins back in the early days on his laptop which later got thrown away into landfill and is now worth  $75 million.  The underpinning technology behind bitcoin is the blockchain, a distributed ledger which is being investigated to solve all sorts of problems in society right now from supply chain management to fixing the internet itself!!!

<hr/>

### Robots

![Robots](/2018/10/Slide14.png#center "")

And all these cheap electronics are being used to create robots. Boston Dynamic build these incredible robots that can walk and run and will transform working in hazardous environments but our lives will more likely be affected by something like the Dyson robot hoover.

<hr/>

### The bots are coming and steeling our jobs

![The bots are coming](/2018/10/Slide15.png#center "")

Companies are bringing all this technology together to build robots, we imagine this to be like the Terminator but actually the bots look more like this. A Workflow and spreadsheet!!!!  Any repatative software task is a candidate for a bot. The classic example in a large company is the process for "resetting" ausers password!!!

The crazy thin here though is that the opportunity for packagin software as "bots" instead of "apps" is that people start to think in human terms. I was in a meeting not so long ago where 4 bots had been deployed into an organisation and now required a line manager to keep and eye on them,

<hr/>

### The Smart robot AI

![The API](/2018/10/Slide16.png#center "")

The most comman application we see of AI being used right now is the the media with diverless cars, it they are being used everywhere. I your recommendations in Amazon to your Facebook feed!! and that Smarts is built on your data.

<hr/>

### XRay Robot

![XRay Diagnosis](/2018/10/Slide17.png#center "")

The greatest example of using Artificial Intelligence is using AI to diagnos patient x-rays.
Thousands of xrays have been loaded into an AI with the results, so that a model can be built of
