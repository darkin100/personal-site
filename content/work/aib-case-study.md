Earlier this year I completed a project with AIB focused on transforming their Mortgage Customer Experience. It was a great project as it was lead by the head of Customer Experience and it was focused on a real customer problem.  Below is a video case study that was put together with AIB talking about the project, challenges and the digital tools we built to support it customer journey.
